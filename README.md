Digital Data Death Manifesto 

---

### Manifesto

1) 
Provide the **tools** for the people to take control of their Data Post Mortem.

2) 
Actively campaign to **educate and raise awareness** about the impact of digital data on our lives both during and after life.

3)
To campaign to **regain and reinstate** control of all our Data.


During our lifetime we create a data trail often spanning years, millions of pieces of Information anything from where we went on holiday to how much money we have in the bank right down to every step we take and where we take them. 

Data that we knowingly create and data that is collected with out our knowledge all contributes to the data trail that we create during out lifetime. We pose the question.

What happens to our data when we die?

Where does it end up? Who does it belong to and how is it used?

##### 3dm is an open movement that aims to contextualize and allow you to regain control of the data that we generate, by providing you with the initial tools to start that process.


We encourage you to contribute and edit relevant tools and information to the movementâ€™s online platform in line with the movements manifesto ethos. Feel free to circulate and distribute as you see fit.
