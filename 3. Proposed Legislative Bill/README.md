# 3. Proposed Legislative Bill

### Summary

**Title:**
Personal Digital-Data Control

**Problem Statement:**
The current appeal aims to draft a law that would allow all the citizens to control the access on their personal data.
Since right now almost anything can be monetized or rendered as information, we are all harvested and profiled as information-capital. We propose a legal framework that protects the citizen of such alienation.

**Proposed Solution:**
We propose that each company, that use the citizen information to fund their activity in such way, should keep the records of each citizen/users separate into a dedicated folder of the company server. This system would give the user the control of their data pre and post mortem. In the case that the users wants to delete their data the company will need to provide the tools to void the contents and delete this folder.
Apart from this the company should provide the option to void from the data hosted on the company database related to this user.

**Major Concerns/Issues:**
At the present the cloud hosting and database technologies is not advanced yet in order to implement these solutions however we believe that by teaming with the right people this solutions con be developed.
